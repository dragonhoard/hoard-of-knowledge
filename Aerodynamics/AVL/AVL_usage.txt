DESCRIPTION OF DOCS
avl_doc	: documentation, how to import aerodynamic data and other detailed information
README	:
session	: keyboard inputs

runs directory: holds data of models (airplanes)
	.avl	: describes configuration or geometry of airplane
	.mass	: describes mass distribution and defines units
	.run	: run case, define different aerodynamic parameters

Avl3 > runs directory:

Example in video: SuperGee 

load file:			load <FILEPATH>
for options of current menu:	?
to look at geometry:		g
	use keys (should be in window) to alter graphics
	<space> to exit
<enter> to return to main menu
to execute a run case: 		x
	will solve system of equations
	can look at trim
	view graphics loading (in geometry)
to look at Trefftz Plane Plot:	t
	shows lift distributuion and state variables
<enter> to return to main menu

to input mass distribution:	mass
	(be in main menu)
also run case file:
	run case lists aerodynamic/flight state
	to run: 	case <FILEPATH>
to go to operation menu: 	oper
	runs until solution converges
	gives deflection
can alter control surface angle use command keys
to save an output/result (ex: stability derivative)
	input:			ST <DESIRED_FILENAME/txt>
		saves to place in computer
		can oppen to see top level results
to export visuals:
	go to geometry menu:	g
	make hardcopy plot:	h
	saves it to a .ps (Postscript file)
	saving other plots will append to the .ps file
	quite program after:	quit
		will save properly
